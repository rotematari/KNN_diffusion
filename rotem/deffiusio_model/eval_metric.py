FID (Fr√©chet Inception Distance) is a metric used to evaluate the similarity between two sets of images.
 In PyTorch, FID score is calculated by first generating image embeddings using a pre-trained Inception-v3 model. 
 These embeddings are then used to calculate the mean and covariance matrix of the generated and real image sets.
Finally, the FID score is calculated using the formula:

FID = ||mu_real - mu_gen||^2 + Tr(C_real + C_gen - 2(C_real*C_gen)^0.5)

where mu_real and mu_gen are the mean embeddings of the real and generated image sets, C_real and C_gen are their covariance matrices, and Tr denotes the trace operator.

PyTorch provides a package called pytorch_fid that can be used to calculate FID score between two sets of images.
